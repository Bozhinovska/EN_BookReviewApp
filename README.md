# EN Book Review Flask App

This project is an **updated version of the original Book Review Application**, which was created in my native language.  
The current version is **fully translated into English**, including all interface elements, database content, and book descriptions.  

It’s a Flask-based web application that allows users to browse, review, and favourite books.  
The app uses **SQLite** as a local database and comes with preloaded book data.

## How to Run the Project

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bozhinovska/EN_BookReviewApp.git
cd EN_BookReviewApp
````

### (Optional) Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

```bash
pip install Flask
```

### Initialize the database

Before running the Flask app, create and populate the database:

```bash
python database.py
```

This will create `book_reviews.db` and all necessary tables.

### Run the Flask application

```bash
python app.py
```

### Open your browser

Go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000

## 💡 Notes

* Run `database.py` **only the first time** to initialize your database.
* Afterwards, just run `app.py` to start the app.
* Default Flask port is **5000**, so the app is accessible at:
[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
